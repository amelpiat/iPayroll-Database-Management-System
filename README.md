# iPayroll-Database-Management-System

The iPayroll Database Management System is a Java-based payroll system using JavaFX for the user interface and SQL for data storage and management. The system provides application users with different capabilities based on their role. Administrators are able to add new employees, modify existing employee data, and access the complete range of system functionalities. Employees have limited access, allowing them to view and update their personal information. This application is ideal for small to medium-sized organizations needing efficient payroll management.
